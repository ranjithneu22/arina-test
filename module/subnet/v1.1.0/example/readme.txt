subnet have dependency on vnet and ddos protection module(if DDos protection is required)

This module creates the Subnet with following features

1. Vnet if not already created by Vnet module
2. Subnet 1: ploceussubnet000001a 
3. ploceussubnet000001a is added to resource group ploceusrg000001 and address_prefixes should be assigned
4: Subnet 2: ploceussubnet0000021b
5. ploceussubnet000001b is added to resource group ploceusrg000001 and address_prefixes should be assigned 
6. Optional features such as service_endpoints,delegation,enforce_private_link_service_network_policies,enforce_private_link_endpoint_network_policies 
   can be added to the subnet module
  

Need to test:

1. Vnet with DDOS protectio needs to be tested.  DDOS protection costs huge.
